    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its signature rich and silky sauce comes
        from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to
        cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle.</p>

    <p>Generally, the pasta used to make Carbonara is spaghetti, but other types of pasta can also be used. The cured
        pork used is called <i>guanciale</i>, which is cured pork cheek, but <i>pancetta</i> or bacon can also be used
        if <i>guanciale</i> is not available. Peccorino Romano is the cheese used for the recipe, but any hard cheese
        will do. And just as a friendly reminder, for the sauce you don't need any type of <em>cream</em>.</p>
